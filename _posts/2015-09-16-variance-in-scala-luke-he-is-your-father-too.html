<p>This week we wanted to share with you a reblog from a <a href="http://blog.stratio.com">Stratio's blog</a> post that talks about variance in Scala:</p>
<blockquote><p>When working with <strong>Big Data</strong>, sometimes it’s useful to remember that powerful products wouldn’t work properly without the tools that build them. It’s possible to start programming in <strong>Scala</strong> with a few case classes and a bunch of for-comprehensions, but those are only little scratches in a huge ice surface like Scala is. It may not be enough to make your code clean and comprehensible.  I’ve been developing with this programming language for almost 4 years, and every day I discover a new feature that surprises me. That acknowledgement, in the end, is the main reason to keep digging deeper into Scala.<span id="more-572"></span></p>
<p>For instance, working with generics can be sometimes really messy, especially when we want to play a little bit with <strong>inheritance</strong> (which turns out to be very common).</p>
<p>It’s very usual to clash with <strong>variance</strong> issues in that case, but not as usual as getting a clear idea about what it really implies. [...]</p></blockquote>
