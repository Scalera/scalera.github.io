<p>We're really proud to announce that, from now, we're becoming a little bit more polyglots :-D</p>
<p>We've been having a look at all published posts so far and, after a hard restoring process, he have remastered them full HD with a spoonful of english (our thanks to <a title="mmartinbarr" href="https://twitter.com/mmartinbarr">@mmartinbarr</a>Â :-D ). What we have in mind is going on publishing in both languages, our mother language Castilian and Shakespeare's language, offering all of our <strong>extensive</strong> knowledge about Scala.</p>
<p>...<strong>extensive</strong>...</p>
