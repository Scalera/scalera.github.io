<p>Before getting affectionate, we wanted to share with you some figures about current year.</p>
<p><a href="https://scalerablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/7kpylaz.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1193"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1193" src="/assets/7kpylaz.png?w=300" alt="7KpyLAZ" width="300" height="253" /></a></p>
<p>Since March 2015 we have:</p>
<p>...published almost <strong>40Â posts</strong> (76 including translations).<br />
...had <strong>+5400 visits</strong>, which...<br />
...<strong>+2500</strong> are different visitors.<br />
...with <strong>187 visits</strong> per day at the most visited post.<br />
...<strong>+140 tweets</strong>.<br />
...<strong>+100 followers</strong> on Twitter.</p>
<p>And all thank to you.</p>
<p>Besides, we got lucky and counted on <a href="https://twitter.com/javifdev">Javier Fuentes</a> collaboration, as you can see at his awesome post about <a href="https://scalerablog.wordpress.com/2015/11/18/shapeless-introduccion-y-hlists-parte-1/">Shapeless</a> (we still owe him some beers). And for next month, we have nearly arranged some other post with another Scala crack.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Now we re going to take a little but well-deserved christmas break.<br />
We promise to be back next year with fully charged batteries and new ideas.</p>
