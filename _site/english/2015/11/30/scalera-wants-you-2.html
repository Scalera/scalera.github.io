<p>If you fit into puzzles basic requirements (age from 0 to 99+) and you master (or only know a bit about) Scala and you have crazy ideas to share: we want you.</p>

<p>Given the awesome welcome that the blog has experimented among people, we would like to get you even more involved. That's why we propose this initiative to look for new collaborators that really aim to share knowledge, practical ideas, common problem solutions related to Scala and its environment. So, if you contribute with at least 3 published posts, we will present a brand new exclusive casual Scalera's staff tshirt to you. </p>
